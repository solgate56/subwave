"""web/scripts/verify-forms.py

Drives the isolated verify stack (controller :7791, web :7793) through every
form converted to react-hook-form. Not part of CI — web/ has no test suite
and the merge gate is lint. This is the evidence for a forms PR; run it
after touching any converted form.

Usage: SUBWAVE_VERIFY_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=1 python3 web/scripts/verify-forms.py [check ...]
Every check in CHECKS runs with no args; name one or more to run a subset.
Every check does DESTRUCTIVE writes (takeovers, whole-array replaces,
create/delete fixtures) authenticated as test/test — see
assert_throwaway_stack() for why the guard is a plain env-var opt-in
(SUBWAVE_VERIFY_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=1) rather than an inferred check.

THE FOUR-STEP SHAPE. Most @check functions drive the same rough arc, though
not every step applies to every form:
  1. Load — navigate, wait for hydration from a real GET, confirm a stored
     value actually reached the bound field.
  2. Validate — drive an actual value through an actual input to trip a
     real client-side rule, and confirm Save/submit disables.
  3. Save — a valid value clears the refusal and a REAL round trip
     persists it, confirmed by reading it back through api() — never trust
     a client-side state flip alone. A server-only rule (an orphan guard,
     a duplicate slug) gets driven for real too, and its refusal must land
     on the right field via assert_field_error/applyServerFieldErrors, not
     a toast standing in for a field message.
  4. Poll-safety — ONLY for panels with a live polling refresh. Call
     page.clock.install() as the FIRST line of the check, before
     page.goto — installed later, the poll's setInterval is created
     outside the fake clock's control and fast_forward can't reach it.
     Always pass assert_survives_poll an explicit seconds= matching the
     panel's REAL interval: its seconds=35 default is calibrated for
     TakeoverCard's 30s poll and proves nothing against a different one
     (see the imaging check's 3s coverage).

SEED AND TEARDOWN. A check that creates a named fixture must best-effort
pre-clean that same name at the top (a prior run may have crashed before
its own teardown) and delete it in a `finally:` (so THIS run can't leave
litter either). Use find_by_name/find_show for the lookup — don't hand-roll
another loop-and-compare.

ID-SCOPED ASSERTIONS, the one convention in this file. Never wait on a bare
page-wide `[aria-invalid="true"]` or `text=must be…` selector — both pass
just as easily when a DIFFERENT field broke. Every wait on invalid state
goes through wait_for_invalid(page, locator), and every message check
through assert_field_error(page, locator, text), both scoped to the
locator's OWN id (a plain field) or aria-labelledby (a group control —
fieldAria's groupProps carries no id, see lib/form.ts).

    selector: a legal DOM id can contain characters that are CSS-selector
    metacharacters (`festivals.0.name-error` has dots, which start a class
    selector), and `page.locator(f"#{token}")` then silently matches nothing
    even though the element is really there (verified directly:

    does plain string matching, not CSS-selector parsing, so a dotted id is
    completely valid there; only the naive selector was wrong, and
    `[id="..."]` matches by exact attribute value with no such parsing.

    Checks BOTH aria-describedby and aria-labelledby — a group control (chips,

    This exists because a naive version of this assertion cannot fail. A

    `wait_for_timeout` looks like it re-triggers the poll, but two things make
    it a no-op: (1) the poll effects here are bare `setInterval(tick, 30_000)`
    calls with no `focus`/`visibilitychange` listener at all — nothing is
    listening for that event — and (2) even a real listener wouldn't fire

    passes whether or not the poll ever runs proves nothing about the bug it
    exists to catch (a stray `values` prop re-seeding the form on every poll).

    The caller must install a fake clock (`page.clock.install()`) BEFORE
    `page.goto`, so every timer the page schedules — including the poll's
    `setInterval` — is one Playwright controls. This jumps the clock past the

    POST /sfx runs validateBody(sfxCreateSchema) (controller routes/sfx.ts) —
    the SAME schema the create modal's zodResolver runs (imported from
    lib/schemas.generated.ts) — so the duration-over-SFX_MAX_SEC refusal
    proven below is a genuine mirror of the server rule, not a UI-only
    constraint invented for this check.

    The real routes are `/sfx` (create) and `/sfx/upload` (import), never
    `/imaging/...` — confirmed by grepping ImagingPanel.tsx's adminFetch
    calls; `/imaging` is only the admin PAGE path (`/admin/imaging?tab=sfx`),
    never an API prefix.

    The persistence round trip is proven through the IMPORT modal, not a real
    generation. Verification runs with every TTS credential neutralised, so
    the browser stubs only GET /sfx's `generatorReady` capability to expose
    the create form's submit state; POSTs remain real and no costed provider
    call is made. Import needs no external API — a real WAV upload through
    /sfx/upload — and shares the same imagingImportSchema name/description
    fields.

    Also covers ImagingPanel's own 3s TanStack Query `refetchInterval` — ten
    times faster than TakeoverCard's 30s, and the panel most likely to exhibit
    the clobber bug `assert_survives_poll` exists to catch. The Jingle ratio
    input is the right target: it's a real on-page control hydrated from the
    shared settings query only while clean, so an in-progress edit must
    survive every background revision. `seconds=3` matches THIS panel's real interval —
    `assert_survives_poll`'s `seconds=35` default is calibrated for
    TakeoverCard's 30s poll and would prove nothing here (it'd fast-forward
    past 11 ticks instead of exercising one real one).

def onboarding(page):
    """The onboarding wizard, converted onto react-hook-form (Task 8):
    NavidromeStep/LlmStep/TtsStep/DjStep each own a useZodForm and their own
    gated "Next" submit; ReviewStep is unchanged (no fields of its own).

    Boots its OWN throwaway controller (port 7792, a fresh temp STATE_DIR, and
    critically NO NAVIDROME_* env at all — that absence is what makes
    needsSetup true) and its OWN second Next dev server (port 7794). Both are
    started and stopped by THIS check, in a `finally`, so this file stays
    runnable as a whole against a freshly booted stack (Task 13's job) with no
    manual step for anyone to forget — that was Task 5's bar.

    Two things make the second web server non-trivial, not just a second
    `npm run dev -p N`:

    1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is inlined into the client bundle at `next dev`
       STARTUP (webpack `DefinePlugin`), not read per request — confirmed by
       reading app/onboarding/page.tsx's `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
       and next.config.js (no rewrite proxies `/api` dynamically). So the
       EXISTING :7793 server this file's other checks use cannot be
       retargeted per request; a second `next dev` process, pointed at 7792
       from the start, is the only way.
    2. A second `next dev` in the SAME source tree collides with the first:
       Next's dev server refuses to start a second instance sharing one
       `.next/dev/lock` file ("Another next dev server is already running",
       confirmed by actually hitting it). The lock path is keyed off
       `distDir`, so this needs its own — `next.config.js` reads
       `SUBWAVE_NEXT_DIST_DIR` (falls back to plain `.next` for every other
       invocation) for exactly this. Building instead of a second dev server
       was considered and rejected: `next build` overwrites the SHARED
       `.next/` output the :7793 dev server is serving from, corrupting it
       for every other check in this file (this is the documented "don't
       `npm run build` while dev server runs" gotcha, and it would fire here
       even though the intent is isolation, since both processes would
       default to the same `.next` without the distDir override).
       `next dev` (not `next start`) is also needed because this worktree's
       `node_modules` is a symlink — Turbopack panics resolving it
       ("Symlink […]/node_modules is invalid"), so this launches with
       `--webpack`, same as every other worktree dev invocation until a real
       `npm install` replaces the symlink.

    Runnable standalone: `python3 web/scripts/verify-forms.py onboarding`.
    Needs nothing pre-booted beyond the repo + node_modules every other check
    already needs — no manual second-stack step for Task 13 or anyone else.

    fieldErrors trace (Task 8's step 6-7): POST /onboarding/save is a
    hand-rolled try/catch (routes/onboarding.ts), not validateBody(schema),
    so it NEVER emits fieldErrors — only `{ok, error}`. The two probe routes
    (test-navidrome, test-llm) DO run validateBody(navidromeProbeSchema /
    llmProbeSchema) and DO carry a fieldErrors object on a 400 — but both
    schemas are `z.unknown().refine(...)` with no `.path()` on the refine, so
    every issue lands at the schema ROOT: flattenIssues produces `{"":
    message}`, not `{provider: message}` or `{url: message}`. There is no
    field to call form.setError() on, so steps.tsx does not wire
    applyServerFieldErrors anywhere in this wizard — doing so would be inert,
    misrepresenting a channel that doesn't functionally exist here (Task 4's
    mistake, not Task 5's). Both halves of that trace are proven below by
    curl, not just cited.

    """PersonasPanel (Task 9) — the roster + system-prompt library on
    react-hook-form. Two field arrays (`personas`, `djPrompts`) bound via
    `useZodForm(z.object({ personas: z.array(personaSchema), djPrompts:
    z.array(djPromptSchema) }))`; `activePersonaId`/`activeDjPromptId`/
    `djHouseRules` stay plain useState (they aren't array rows).

    Unlike webhooks/festivals (every row rendered simultaneously as a card),
    this editor is single-focus: ONE persona's fields render at a time inside
    a full-screen dialog (`PersonaEditor`), selected by `focusIdx`. Assertion
    4 below proves the row-indexing property by switching FOCUS between two
    already-open rows in the same form instance, not by reading two rows off
    the page at once.

    applyServerFieldErrors trace (read against controller/src/routes/
    settings/core.ts, middleware/validate.ts, settings/patch-registry.ts,
    schemas/persona.ts): `personas` IS one of the 26 converted `/settings`
    patch-registry keys — `validateSettingsBody()` runs `personasSchema`
    (== `z.array(personaSchema)`, the SAME schema this form's zodResolver
    runs) BEFORE the route handler, so a bad persona never reaches
    `settings.update()`; the middleware itself answers the 400 with
    `fieldErrors`. Traced empirically (a real safeParse against a 3-persona
    array with a bad `tts` in the MIDDLE entry):
        fieldErrors: { "personas.1.tts": "tts.voice must be 1-100 chars" }
    `ttsVoiceSlotSchema` (schemas/persona.ts) is ONE `.transform()` over the
    whole `{engine, cloudProvider, voice, gainDb, speed}` slot with no
    `.path()` on its `ctx.addIssue` calls, so the error is rooted at
    `personas.<i>.tts` — never deeper (`.tts.voice`) — which is exactly why
    PersonaVoiceCard binds ONE `useController` over the whole `tts` object
    rather than a `SelectField` per subfield: only a control literally
    subscribed at that exact path can pick the error up at all.

    Because personaSchema is the identical mirror on both sides, there is NO
    client-accepts/server-rejects gap for THIS rule the way skills()'s
    duplicate-slug or moods()'s orphan-guard have one — the editor's own Save
    gate (`formState.isValid`) already refuses to submit a persona whose tts
    the schema would flag, so a real end-to-end 400 for this exact rule is
    not reachable by driving the UI honestly. What IS proven for real: a
    mocked `POST /settings` response carrying the controller's ACTUAL,
    traced `fieldErrors` shape (`personas.1.tts`, the real path + a real
    message the schema emits) reaches `applyServerFieldErrors` and lands on
    the RIGHT persona's Voice field, not persona 0's — which is the field-
    array wiring this task exists to prove, and is exactly the kind of bug
    (an off-by-one, or a collapse-to-index-0 in the row mapping) an honest
    round trip and a mocked one would catch identically, since neither the
    client nor the server does any index remapping of its own.

def shows(page):
    """ShowsPanel + ShowEditor (Task 10) — the second master-detail panel, and
    the only schema in the whole react-hook-form migration that is a FACTORY:
    `showSchema(ctx)` cannot be validated against itself because `personaId`
    has to name a real persona, `moods` a live mood, `themeId` an installed
    theme, and `maxTrackSeconds` clears a floor derived from the station's
    crossfade. The browser passes all four (ShowsPanel's `showCtx`), which is
    what makes the three assertions below possible at all.

    Bound via `useZodForm(z.object({shows: z.array(showSchema(showCtx))}),
    {shows: []})`, `showCtx`/the schema object both memoised on identity
    (showSchema is documented as a heavyweight ~20-pipeline factory). One
    `useFieldArray({name: 'shows', keyName: '_rhfKey'})`; `schedule` stays a
    plain useState — this panel loads it read-only for the hours-a-week counts
    and never saves it (the weekly grid + PUT /schedule live on the separate
    Rundown page, already converted separately and out of scope here).

    trigger()-vs-remount, and how it was actually determined: read directly
    against node_modules/react-hook-form/dist/index.cjs.js's `useForm` body —
    `const o = r.current.control; return o._options = t, ...` runs
    UNCONDITIONALLY on every render (not gated behind a ref, an effect, or a
    dirty-check), so `control._options.resolver` always reflects the LATEST
    `zodResolver(schema)` passed to `useZodForm` on the render that just
    committed. `form.trigger()` reads `_options.resolver` at CALL time, so a
    `trigger()` fired from a `useEffect(() => {...}, [showCtx])` — which by
    definition runs AFTER the render that produced the new `showCtx` — always
    sees the current schema, never a stale one captured at mount. No remount
    needed anywhere, confirmed by inspecting the actual diff (ShowEditor is
    still keyed by show id and remounts on FOCUS switch, exactly as before
    this task — that key was never about validation).

    This was also confirmed empirically, by sabotage (not part of this
    committed check — see the task report for the exact before/after
    transcript): temporarily deleting ShowsPanel's `useEffect(() => {void
    form.trigger()}, [showCtx])` reproduces a REAL bug, not a contrived one.
    `resetForm({shows})` and `setData(j)` (which is what makes `showCtx` go
    from its default empty context to the real one) run back-to-back in the
    same synchronous callback, so a `trigger()` fired inline right after
    `resetForm` — the naive placement — would run against the schema from the
    PREVIOUS render, built from the empty-context default
    (`personaIds: []`) that showCtx starts at before `data` loads. Every
    already-valid show's `personaId` fails `ctx.personaIds.includes(v)`
    against that empty list, so EVERY row reads "incomplete" immediately after
    a real page load until something re-validates it — which, without the
    ctx-keyed effect, only happens once the operator touches a field. With the
    effect restored, the SAME sequence validates correctly because the effect
    runs one tick later, after `showCtx` has already updated to the real
    roster.

    Where each cross-field rule's error actually roots (traced against
    controller/src/schemas/show.ts, confirmed by reading the schema, not
    guessed): `personaId`'s `.refine(v => ctx.personaIds.includes(v))` roots
    at `personaId` itself; `maxTrackSeconds`'s floor `.refine()` roots at
    `maxTrackSeconds` itself; the guest-is-host rule is a `.check()` on the
    whole object that explicitly pushes its issue at `path: ['guestPersonaIds']`
    — all three root at a real, distinct, field-addressable path (unlike Task
    9's `tts` slot, which rooted at the whole object). Despite that, ShowEditor
    binds `personaId` through a raw `useController` + a plain `<Select>`, NOT
    the `SelectField` wrapper — not because the error roots anywhere deeper,
    but because switching the host has to explicitly `trigger()` the SIBLING
    `guestPersonaIds` path (react-hook-form's lazy error population is keyed
    per PATH, not per field-that-changed — a plain `field.onChange` from
    `SelectField` can't fire that re-trigger, and without it Save reads as
    enabled off a stale `errors` tree even though `isValid` already disagrees;
    see ShowEditor.tsx's `personaIdCtl` comment for the full trace).
    `maxTrackSeconds`/`guestPersonaIds` each get their own single
    `useController` too (a clamping onChange and a chip-array onChange,
    respectively — real work by the same header rule).

    Assertion 3 (guest-is-host) needed one real behaviour change to become
    reachable through the UI at all: the pre-RHF editor's host picker cleared
    any guest matching the newly-picked host as a side effect ("the new host
    can't also sit in the guest chairs"), which is a nice UX default but also
    made the invalid state structurally unreachable by driving the UI
    honestly — selecting a host always vacated that seat first. Dropped, and
    documented in ShowEditor's personaId Controller comment: Save now refuses
    instead and names the guests field, which is what this assertion actually
    proves.

    Assertion 1 (host not a live persona) turned out to be UNREACHABLE by any
    real API call, and that took an actual failed attempt to discover, not a
    guess: the first version of this check created a throwaway show pointing
    at a real persona (Hale) and then removed Hale from the roster via a
    `personas`-only PATCH, expecting the show's stored `personaId` to go
    stale. It didn't — the show vanished outright. Reading
    controller/src/settings.ts around its "Post-patch integrity sweep"
    comment (~line 1982) shows why: `next.shows = next.shows.filter(s =>
    personaIds.includes(s.personaId))` runs INSIDE `update()`
    UNCONDITIONALLY, in a bare block with no `if ('shows' in patch)` or
    `if ('personas' in patch)` guard — every single `settings.update()` call,
    whatever keys it patches, filters every show's host against the CURRENT
    roster and drops the ones that don't resolve. Confirmed empirically too
    (`curl` transcript, not just the source read): POST a show hosted by
    Hale → `GET /settings` shows it; POST `{"personas": [...without Hale]}` →
    `GET /settings` shows the show gone, not merely host-invalid. So a show
    with a dangling `personaId` cannot exist in PERSISTED state, full stop —
    not "the client already refuses what the server would", the stronger
    claim that the inconsistent STATE itself cannot be constructed by any
    caller, client or server, ever, including a backup restore (which also
    goes through `update()`). What's proven below instead, the same
    `page.route()`-mock technique Task 9 used for its one unreachable rule:
    the CLIENT's own validation machinery, fed a hypothetically inconsistent
    `GET /settings` response (the shape a stale cache, a future server bug, or
    a self-hosted variant with a different sweep could in principle hand it),
    correctly flags the host field and refuses to save — proving the wiring
    works even though the current server can never trigger it honestly.

    schemas/playlist.ts's header comment — so `playlistHasIntent(buildBody())`
    stays the real Generate gate, called directly, exactly as before
    conversion; see the split comment at the top of PlaylistBuilderPanel.tsx).
    The save modal is a second, separate form bound to playlistSaveSchema
    itself: `name` is the ONE real rule in the whole playlist schema module
    (1-120 chars), which is what assertion 2 below exercises. `saveMode`
    rides in this form too but is NOT a schema key — assertion 4 pins the
    Fix round 1 regression where reading it off handleSubmit's (schema-
    parsed, `saveMode`-stripping) output made every "Overwrite existing"
    save silently create a duplicate instead.

    Reaching the deck (tracks.length > 0) needs a generation result, which in
    the real app comes from POST /playlists/generate/jobs over a live
    Navidrome + curation model. This verify stack's controller is started
    with an UNREACHABLE Navidrome on purpose for the other checks
    (NAVIDROME_URL=http://localhost:9999) — confirmed directly against the
    running stack (`curl -u test:test localhost:7791/dj/search?q=a` and
    `.../playlists` both answer `{"error":"fetch failed"}`), so there is no
    honest way to generate or persist a REAL playlist here. Generate and Save
    are therefore mocked at the browser's fetch boundary — the same
    `page.route()` technique shows()'s assertion 1 uses for its one
    server-unreachable rule — so what's under test is the CLIENT's own
    wiring (does the form assemble the real wire body, does it apply the
    server's response), not Navidrome reachability. Assertion 3 is proved
    against that mocked POST /playlists response rather than a real
    `api('/playlists')` GET round-trip, because that GET is equally
    unreachable here; the mock's own assertions on the posted body (name,
    songIds) are what stand in for "persisted correctly".

    The brief's other named assertion — "a backwards year window (yearFrom >
    yearTo) refuses" — does not correspond to any real rule anywhere in the
    system: knobs/eras carry no zod validation (playlistLooseRecord is
    deliberately unchecked passthrough) and no server logic rejects an
    inverted window either (music/playlist-gen.ts's matchesEra just filters
    every track out, indistinguishable from an over-narrow window that
    happens to match nothing). The DualRange widget instead makes the state
    UNREACHABLE BY CONSTRUCTION: its onLo/onHi clamp the incoming value
    against the OTHER thumb before either prop fires
    (playlist-builder/bits.tsx), so dragging "from" past "to" carries "to"
    along with it rather than crossing it — which is what assertion 1 proves

def assert_throwaway_stack():
    """Refuses to run a single check until the caller has EXPLICITLY opted
    into destructive writes against `API`/`WEB` — an env var, not an
    inference.

    Every check in this file does destructive, whole-array-replace writes —
    60-minute takeovers via `POST /schedule/override`, a full `POST /settings`
    personas-roster replace, show/rule/skill/festival create-and-delete — and
    they all authenticate as `test`/`test` (AUTH, above). Pointed at a real
    operator's station (a stale `SUBWAVE_HOME`, a command copy-pasted into the
    wrong shell) this would scribble over their actual configuration with no
    confirmation prompt anywhere in the file.

    An earlier version of this guard tried to INFER "throwaway" from two
    signals: test/test credentials authenticating, plus the persona roster
    containing the seeded names Marlowe/Wren/Hale. That inference does not
    hold: `SEED_PERSONAS` (`controller/src/settings/vocab.ts`) — the roster
    `defaults.ts` seeds on every FRESH install — is exactly Marlowe/Wren/Hale.
    Any real operator who hasn't yet customised personas satisfies both
    signals simultaneously; they aren't independent evidence of "throwaway",
    they're both just "this is an unconfigured install", which a real station
    legitimately is for a while after setup. A guard that reads as protection
    but doesn't protect is worse than none — it stops the next person from
    adding a real one, on the belief the risk is already covered.

    So the load-bearing check is now a plain opt-in: the caller must set
    `SUBWAVE_VERIFY_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=1` (or any other truthy-looking value —
    see `_env_truthy`) before running this file at all, which the product
    never sets on its own. `.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md`'s documented
    isolated-controller boot is the one place that should ever export it.

    The old credential + roster checks are kept, but now purely as a
    SECONDARY sanity check that runs only once the opt-in has already been
    proven — they can turn a wrong-target opt-in into a clearer error message
    (e.g. "wrong port"), but they never substitute for the opt-in and never
    grant permission on their own.

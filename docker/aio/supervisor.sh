#
# It fails worse than ANALYZER_HEAVY did, which is why it gets its own warning
# rather than a docs line. ANALYZER_HEAVY set on a lean AIO withholds a feature
# the operator wanted; ANALYZER_REPLICAS=0 set on an AIO withholds NOTHING and
# silently keeps charging for it — the whole point of setting 0 is usually to
# stop paying for analysis, and here analysis carries on with its RAM and its
# CPU while the operator believes it is off. Nothing in the UI contradicts them
# either: the acoustic engine keeps reading "on", which looks like the switch
# is broken rather than absent.
#
# So the warning names the knob that DOES work here: an empty ANALYZE_PYTHON.

"""
subwave-tts-heavy — optional Chatterbox + PocketTTS sidecar for SUB/WAVE.

The controller (audio/chatterbox.ts, audio/pocketTts.ts) talks to this over
HTTP when TTS_HEAVY_URL is set. A thin FastAPI shim over two long-lived
subprocesses — the SAME stdio workers the controller runs in-process
(controller/scripts/{chatterbox,pocket_tts}_worker.py), one venv each because
the two packages have incompatible pip resolutions. One JSON object per line
over stdin/stdout; an asyncio.Lock per worker serialises requests. No audio
over the wire — the sidecar writes the WAV to the absolute `out` path on the
shared /var/sub-wave volume and the controller hands that path to Liquidsoap.

Engines do not stay resident forever: after TTS_HEAVY_IDLE_UNLOAD_S without
a render the supervisor stops that engine's worker and reloads it on the next
/speak (or ahead of one, on /warm). See the idle-unload block below for why
the reclaim is a process exit rather than an in-process release (#1579).

Endpoints:
  GET  /health   → {ok, engines, cold, chatterbox_loaded, pocket_loaded}
  POST /speak    → {ok, path, duration_s}
    body: {engine, text, voice?, reference_wav?, out}
  POST /warm     → {ok, warming, disabled, loaded, cold}
    body: {engine?}   (omitted / empty = every enabled engine)

# --- idle unload (#1579) ----------------------------------------------------
# Chatterbox is ~4GB resident — weights plus, on CUDA, torch's context — and it
# used to be held for the life of the container whether or not the station had
# spoken in twelve hours. The programme's idle pause (stream.idleAfterMinutes)
# stands the MUSIC down when the room empties but has no reach in here, which
# is the specific surprise operators hit. So each worker gets its own idle
# clock: after this many seconds without a render, stop it; reload on the next
# /speak, or ahead of one on /warm.
#
# The reclaim is a PROCESS EXIT, not an in-process `del model`, and that is the
# whole design. #1204 established on the analyzer that dropping the model
# singletons leaves torch's imported modules — and on CUDA its context —
# resident until the process ends, so an in-process release hands back only
# part of the memory and the operator still sees gigabytes pinned. Exiting is
# also nearly free here: run() is already a restart supervisor, so "unload"
# is one terminate away and the workers themselves need no idle protocol.
#
# The window must sit well ABOVE the station's natural talk cadence or the
# reload becomes the new normal: the talk scheduler can offer the segment
# director a minute every five, so a five-minute window would thrash a station
# that is merely between links rather than idle. Thirty minutes of total
# silence is three times the idle-pause default and unreachable by a station
# that is on air and talking. CUDA is tighter than CPU because VRAM contention
# is urgent in a way that host RAM is not, and a GPU reload is the fast one.

# Per-engine, not per-sidecar: this container carries both engines, and an
# operator who uses one and not the other should not have the unused engine's

# below (they go through helpers now, so grepping for os.environ finds only
# half of them). This service has no `env_file:` — its `environment:` list in
# each compose file is the entire surface — so a name here that is missing from
# one of those files is a setting the operator can put in the root .env and
# watch do nothing. #1579 shipped exactly that with TTS_HEAVY_LOAD_TIMEOUT_S.
# scripts/tts_heavy_idle_test.py drives all three compose copies off this tuple.
#
# Everything else server.py reads is an image-internal path (the per-worker
# CHATTERBOX_PYTHON / _WORKER / _HF_HOME set in env_extra or the Dockerfile),
# not something an operator sets.
#
# CHATTERBOX_REFERENCE_WAV was the one judgement call, and #1579 left it out on
# the grounds that every /speak carries the persona's own reference_wav so the
# env default is unreachable. It is not: a line spoken by a persona with NO
# voice of its own arrives with an empty reference_wav, and the worker reads
# `req.get("reference_wav") or DEFAULT_REFERENCE` — which is exactly what the
# LOCAL (AIO) chatterbox path has always honoured (controller audio/chatterbox
# .ts passes it into the worker env). So the two paths disagreed, and the
# sidecar was the one that dropped it. It is a knob (#1591).

# Heavy voices & acoustic analysis

SUB/WAVE ships lean. The default install runs the fast, local **Piper** voice
and tags your library from text alone. Two heavier capabilities go beyond that —
and they're now packaged **separately**, because they have very different
weights:

1. **Acoustic analysis** — measuring each track's tempo, key, and loudness, and
   fingerprinting *how it sounds* so the DJ can mix on feel, not just tags. This
   powers the energy/pace/loudness signals in the
   [Library Observatory](#what-analysis-adds). It runs in the **`analyzer`**
   sidecar, which **starts by default** — so on a normal install it's already on
   and most operators need to do nothing.
2. **Expressive TTS voices** — Chatterbox and PocketTTS, which sound noticeably
   more natural than Piper. These carry multi-gigabyte speech models and stay
   **opt-in**, in the separate **`tts-heavy`** sidecar you turn on yourself.

So the two headings below split accordingly: [the analyzer](#acoustic-analysis-runs-by-default)
is already running, and [turning on the voices](#turn-on-the-voices) is the
one-line change. (The AIO one-click image bundles the analyzer in-process, so it
has analysis too, without a second container.)

> **The data is never lost when the engine is off.** Your tags and analysis
> live in `state/library.db` (`/var/sub-wave/library.db` inside the container).
> The "acoustic engine on/off" indicator is a *live reachability check* for the
> analysis backend — not a stored setting. When the analyzer is down, existing
> data stays put; you just can't run *new* analysis until it's back up.

## Acoustic analysis runs by default

Analysis lives in its own **`analyzer`** sidecar (`subwave-analyzer`), which
**starts with the rest of the stack** — no flag, no profile. A default
`docker compose up -d` brings it up next to the controller and web, and the
controller finds it automatically via `ANALYZE_URL=http://analyzer:8080`. After
your first library scan (**admin → Library → Rescan**, tick *re-analyse*), tracks
start getting tempo/key/loudness.

- **Lean & multi-arch by default.** The published image is ~1.1 GB (librosa +
  ffmpeg, **no PyTorch**) and runs natively on amd64 **and arm64**
  (NAS/Pi/Apple-Silicon). It covers bpm/key/intro/loudness.
- **"Sounds-like" + vocals are the heavy opt-in.** CLAP audio embeddings and
  Demucs vocal ranges add a CPU-torch stack (the `-heavy` image is ~1.9 GB) that
  isn't in the lean image. Enable them with **one line in `.env`** —
  [see below](#enabling-sounds-like--vocals-the-heavy-tier).
- **Turn it off.** One line in `.env` — `ANALYZER_REPLICAS=0` — and the next
  `docker compose up -d` removes the container for good.
  [Full details](#turning-the-analyzer-off).
- **AIO.** The all-in-one image bundles the analyzer *in-process* (a local
  `librosa` venv the controller drives directly), so the one-click container has
  analysis with no second service. (`subwave-aio` is lean; `subwave-aio-heavy`
  bakes CLAP + Demucs, and `subwave-aio-cuda` runs that same pair on an NVIDIA
  GPU.)
- **Fallbacks.** If the `analyzer` service isn't reachable, the controller falls
  back to a [local venv](#running-analysis-without-a-sidecar-dev--offline).
  (`tts-heavy` is TTS-only now — it no longer carries the analyzer.)

Everything under [What analysis adds](#what-analysis-adds) applies here. The rest
of this page is about the **voices** — a separate opt-in.

### Turning the analyzer off

You may not want a local analyzer container at all — the usual reason is that
analysis already runs **somewhere else**, on a GPU box you point at with
`ANALYZE_URL` ([below](#running-the-analyzer-on-another-machine)), so the
in-compose one just sits there idle holding ~1.1 GB of image. Or you simply
don't want acoustic data and would rather have the RAM back.

One line in the root `.env`:

```ini
# root .env — 0 removes the container; unset (or empty) = 1 = the default
ANALYZER_REPLICAS=0
```

Then `docker compose up -d`. The container is **stopped and removed**, and stays
gone across every subsequent `up`, `restart` and reboot. Set the line back to
`1` (or delete it) and the next `up -d` recreates it.

**`0` and `1` are the only valid values.** The service pins
`container_name: sub-wave-analyzer` so the rest of the stack and the docs can
name it, and Compose refuses a fixed container name for more than one replica —
so `ANALYZER_REPLICAS=2` fails *every* Compose command with
`can't set container_name and analyzer as container name must be unique`, not
just `up`. A non-integer (`ANALYZER_REPLICAS=false`) is likewise a hard
interpolation error rather than a silent fallback; the variable is named for a
count, not a boolean, so that nobody reaches for `false` and then cannot boot.

This replaces the old advice of `docker compose stop analyzer`, which had to be
repeated after *every* `up -d` — `up` restarts a service you stopped by hand.

**What happens with no analyzer.** Nothing breaks and nothing is lost. The
controller probes `ANALYZE_URL`, gets no answer, falls back to a
[local venv](#running-analysis-without-a-sidecar-dev--offline) if one is
configured, and otherwise resolves **no backend at all**. An analysis pass then
returns immediately with a single log line —

```
[analyze] no analysis backend (ANALYZE_URL sidecar / ANALYZE_PYTHON venv) — skipping
```

— rather than erroring per track. **Text tagging is untouched**: it runs on the
LLM and never consults the analyzer, so a tagging pass works exactly as before.
Existing bpm/key/loudness data stays in `state/library.db`; the admin Library
panel's **Acoustic analysis · bpm / key** row simply reads `engine off` (and
the sounds-like row with it) until a backend answers again.

**It's Compose-only.** The AIO one-click image runs the analyzer **in-process**
(a `librosa` venv the controller drives over stdio), not as a service, so there
is no container for `ANALYZER_REPLICAS` to remove and the variable does nothing
there. Setting it to `0` on an AIO is the trap: analysis keeps running and keeps
its RAM, so the supervisor logs a warning at boot naming the variable that
*does* work there. To actually stop an AIO analysing, blank the built-in
`ANALYZE_PYTHON` variable (set it to an empty value) — the controller reads an
empty path as "no local backend". To send an AIO's analysis elsewhere instead,
set `ANALYZE_URL`: a reachable sidecar wins over the in-process venv.

### Enabling "sounds-like" + vocals (the heavy tier)

The CLAP "sounds-like" embeddings and Demucs vocal ranges ship in a separate
`subwave-analyzer-heavy` image. Switching to it is one line — **no rebuild**:

```ini
# root .env
ANALYZER_HEAVY=1
```

Then `docker compose up -d` (Compose re-pulls the `analyzer` service as
`subwave-analyzer-heavy`). By install type:

- **Cloned install / CLI / raw compose.** Add the line to `.env` and `up -d`.
  The `subwave setup` wizard also asks ("Enable heavy analysis?") and writes it
  for you.
- **Unraid split-stack (Compose Manager).** Add `ANALYZER_HEAVY=1` to your `.env`,
  **Save**, then **Pull & Up**.
- **Unraid one-click (AIO).** There's no second container to swap — instead point
  the container's **Repository** at `ghcr.io/perminder-klair/subwave-aio-heavy`
  and re-pull. (Got an NVIDIA card? Use `subwave-aio-cuda` and pass the GPU
  through instead — [full steps](unraid.md#acoustic-analysis-default-on--expressive-voices-opt-in).)

The heavy image is **amd64-only** (the CPU-torch stack). On an arm64 host also
set `DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64` — it runs under emulation (slow, but
analysis is a one-time per-track pass).

### The heavy image needs to reach huggingface.co once

**Model weights are not baked into the image.** The heavy analyzer downloads
CLAP (and Demucs) from `huggingface.co` the first time it is actually asked for
a sounds-like or vocals pass, into the `analyzer-cache` volume mounted at
`/opt/analyzer/hf-cache`. That is a deliberate trade — baking them would add
roughly a gigabyte to an image most people pull over a home connection — but it
does mean the heavy tier has a **one-time outbound network dependency**, and
that dependency is easy to miss because everything else about the station works
offline.

On a host with no outbound reach you'll see this in `docker logs
sub-wave-analyzer`:

```
[analyze] '[Errno 111] Connection refused' thrown while requesting HEAD
https://huggingface.co/laion/clap-htsat-unfused/resolve/main/model.safetensors
[analyze-worker] CLAP load failed
```

The station keeps working — bpm, key, loudness and intros are pure librosa and
need no download — but the sounds-like meter stays at zero. The admin Library
panel says so directly, with the reason, rather than suggesting you switch
image: you're already on the right one.

Three ways out:

- **Let it out once.** The download is a few hundred MB and happens once per
  volume. Once the cache is warm the analyzer never calls out again.
- **Pre-seed the cache from another machine.** The cache is a plain
  [HF cache directory](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/manage-cache).
  On a box that *does* have reach:
  ```bash
  pip install huggingface_hub
  HF_HOME=./hf-cache huggingface-cli download laion/clap-htsat-unfused
  ```
  then copy `hf-cache/` onto the analyzer's volume (`docker cp ./hf-cache/.
  sub-wave-analyzer:/opt/analyzer/hf-cache/`) and restart the analyzer.
- **Point at your own copy.** `CLAP_MODEL` accepts a local path as well as a hub
  id, so a weights directory you already mirror can be used directly.

Once the cause is fixed, **restart whatever is holding the analyzer**. The
failure is remembered until you do — deliberately, because that is what stops
the analysis pass re-attempting the same tracks on every run and reporting the
same "+N tracks missing an audio vector" count forever. Which process that is
depends on your install, and the admin panel names the right one for yours:

- **Sidecar** (the default compose stacks): `docker compose restart analyzer`.
  The failure is remembered inside the analyzer container, across the idle
  worker respawn that used to reset it.
- **AIO, or a local librosa venv**: there is no separate analyzer — the worker
  is a child of the controller and the failure is remembered in the controller
  process, so restart *that* (on the AIO, the container). `docker compose
  restart analyzer` has nothing to act on there.

### Heavy analysis on an NVIDIA GPU (CUDA)

On a host with an NVIDIA card, the heavy stack can run CLAP + Demucs on the GPU
— a big speed-up on deep library ingestion. Audio decode/resampling and the
baseline bpm/key/loudness/structure pass remain CPU work; CUDA accelerates the
model stages rather than replacing the whole analyzer. A sounds-like backfill
over tracks whose baseline analysis is already current skips those baseline
features, and batches each track's CLAP windows into one CUDA model call.

By default the base `docker-compose.yml` selects the CPU analyzer. To keep the
CUDA image and GPU reservation on every Compose command, set `COMPOSE_FILE` in
`.env`:

```dotenv
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.analyzer-gpu.yml
```

With that line present, normal rebuilds and restarts keep using the CUDA analyzer.
Remove the line to return to the CPU analyzer. This remains opt-in because the
GPU overlay must not be enabled by default on CPU-only hosts.

That swaps the `analyzer` service to the `subwave-analyzer-cuda` image (heavy +
cu124 torch wheels) and hands it the GPU. Requirements: the NVIDIA driver +
[NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
— nothing else; the CUDA runtime rides inside the image. The worker picks the
device itself (`ANALYZE_DEVICE=auto`): if the GPU isn't actually visible it logs
a warning and falls back to CPU rather than failing the pass. `ANALYZER_HEAVY`
is irrelevant while the overlay is applied — the image is overridden outright.

Running the **all-in-one** container instead? It has no `analyzer` service to
swap, so there's no overlay: pull the `subwave-aio-cuda` tag (the heavy AIO built
on the same cu124 wheels) and hand the container the GPU directly. Steps for
Unraid, including the driver plugin and the extra parameters, are in
[unraid.md](unraid.md#acoustic-analysis-default-on--expressive-voices-opt-in);
anywhere else it's `--gpus all` on your `docker run`. Everything below about
device selection and VRAM applies there unchanged.

Sharing the card with a local TTS or LLM? The worker plays nice: after ~5
minutes with no CLAP/Demucs use it drops its models out of VRAM and reloads
them on the next request (`ANALYZE_IDLE_UNLOAD_S` in `.env` tunes the window;
`0` keeps them resident; CPU-only hosts get the same release with a longer
30-minute default — #1204). The trade: the first heavy request after a release
pays a cold reload from the on-disk cache — a few seconds for CLAP on a typical
box (measured ~2s; a "sounds like ..." search may feel it on slower hardware),
longer for Demucs. If your station leans on sound search and RAM is plentiful,
`ANALYZE_IDLE_UNLOAD_S=0` restores the old always-resident behaviour. A few
hundred MB of CUDA context remain until the analyzer container stops. Pair it with the **quiet times** toggle on the admin
Library page and a long scan pauses — and frees the GPU — whenever listeners
are tuned in.

### Running the analyzer on another machine

Everything above assumes the card is in the same host as the station. If it
isn't — the station lives on a NAS or a mini-PC and the GPU is in a desktop
somewhere else — you do **not** have to move the station, and you certainly
don't have to stop the stack and copy `appdata` to the GPU box and back.

The analyzer is a plain HTTP service, and the controller resolves its backend
from one variable:

```ini
# root .env, on the STATION host
ANALYZE_URL=http://192.168.1.101:8080
```

It probes `{ANALYZE_URL}/health` for the `analyze` capability and, when that
answers, sends analysis there instead of to the local `analyzer` container. Use
a LAN or Tailscale address — `localhost` is the *controller container's*
loopback.

The fast path still uses shared storage: the controller pre-fetches each track
to `/var/sub-wave/analyze-tmp/` and hands that path to the analyzer. If the
remote analyzer cannot read the path, it returns the typed `422
path_unavailable` response and the controller retries that track by URL. That
makes a share-less remote analyzer work without copying station state, though
the remote service must then download each admitted track itself.

Remote URL fetching is where bounded concurrency is useful: download/decode for
some tracks can overlap inference on others. Set the same value on both hosts:

```ini
# root .env on the STATION host (controller's active-request limit)
ANALYZE_CONCURRENCY=2
```

```yaml
# GPU host analyzer service (number of independent worker processes)
environment:
  - ANALYZE_CONCURRENCY=2
```

The default is `1`, preserving the existing single-flight pass. Values `2`–`4`
are sensible starting points for a remote GPU, with a supported maximum of `8`.
Each sidecar worker is an independent Python process and may load its own CLAP
and Demucs models, so raising the value increases CPU, RAM and VRAM use as well
as network and Navidrome/source-server demand. A mismatch is safe but effective
parallelism is limited by the smaller usable side. This is an operator tuning
trade-off, not a guaranteed speedup.

A same-path state mount is therefore **recommended for throughput, but required
only for stem caching**. Stem rendering writes into `state/stems/`; a remote
machine cannot send those files back through the URL fallback.

So, on the GPU host:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml on the GPU MACHINE — analyzer only.
services:
  analyzer:
    # -heavy is CLAP + Demucs on the CPU, and is amd64-only. For the GPU, swap
    # in subwave-analyzer-cuda and add the `deploy:` block below.
    image: ghcr.io/perminder-klair/subwave-analyzer-heavy:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - ANALYZE_CONCURRENCY=2  # match the station host; default 1
    volumes:
      # Optional for ordinary analysis; recommended for the prefetch fast path
      # and REQUIRED for stem caching. It must resolve to the station's state
      # files at this exact path. NFS/SMB is the usual choice; the AIO's
      # equivalent is the appdata share.
      - /mnt/subwave-state:/var/sub-wave
      - analyzer-cache:/opt/analyzer/hf-cache
    # CUDA image only — same reservation docker-compose.analyzer-gpu.yml applies
    # (that file also documents the legacy `runtime: nvidia` fallback).
    # deploy:
    #   resources:
    #     reservations:
    #       devices:
    #         - driver: nvidia
    #           count: all
    #           capabilities: [gpu]
volumes:
  analyzer-cache:
```

Then set `ANALYZE_URL` on the station host and `docker compose up -d`. Sanity
checks, in order:

1. `curl http://<gpu-host>:8080/health` from the **station** host — expect
   `"ok": true` with `analyze` in `engines`.
2. If you configured the shared-state fast path, run
   `docker compose exec analyzer ls /var/sub-wave/analyze-tmp` on the **GPU**
   host while a scan runs. Empty or unreadable means the controller will use
   slower URL downloads; fix the mount before enabling stem caching.
3. Watch the station's analyze log. A one-time `using URL downloads` warning
   confirms the share-less fallback is active. Timeouts are ambiguous — the
   per-track deadline is
   `ANALYZE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` (120s by default), and reading a long track
   across a slow share *plus* the DSP can outrun it on a link that is otherwise
   working. Raise it before concluding the URL is wrong.

Turn the local `analyzer` service off so you aren't paying for a redundant idle
image — add `ANALYZER_REPLICAS=0` to the station host's `.env`
([details](#turning-the-analyzer-off)). That replaces the old advice of running
`docker compose stop analyzer` after every `up -d`, which had to be repeated
because `up` restarts a stopped service. And if you use the shared path, mind
that it needs read permission for staged audio and write permission for stems
under the analyzer's user.

## Voices: why they're off by default

The `tts-heavy` sidecar carries PyTorch and the Chatterbox/PocketTTS speech
models — it's a multi-gigabyte image and wants real CPU (or a GPU). Most people
running a small radio station on a NAS or a spare box don't want that weight by
default, so SUB/WAVE gates the *voices* behind a Docker Compose **profile**. The
controller is *already wired* to talk to it
(`TTS_HEAVY_URL=http://tts-heavy:8080` in all three compose files); the only
thing missing on a default boot is the container itself.

When the profile is off, the URL is unreachable, the controller's `isAvailable()`
probe returns false within ~30s, and the DJ falls back to Piper. Nothing
breaks — you just get the light path. (Analysis is unaffected: it has its own
default-on `analyzer` service, above.)

---

## Turn on the voices

The `tts-heavy` container exists in every compose file under the `tts-heavy`
profile. You enable a profile in one of two ways, depending on how you start the
stack.

### Cloned install / raw `docker compose`

Pass the profile flag on `up`:

```bash
docker compose --profile tts-heavy up -d
# dev:  docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --profile tts-heavy up -d
# byo:  docker compose -f docker-compose.byo.yml  --profile tts-heavy up -d
```

The first start pulls (or builds) the image — expect ~1–2 GB and a few minutes.

### Environments where you can't pass `--profile` (Unraid, Portainer, etc.)

Compose Manager Plus on Unraid and most one-click UIs run `up` for you, so you
can't add a flag. Instead, activate the profile from the **`.env`** with the
standard Compose variable:

```ini
COMPOSE_PROFILES=tts-heavy
```

Then **Pull & Up** the stack as usual. `COMPOSE_PROFILES` is read by Docker
Compose itself, so the sidecar starts without any CLI flag. See
[`unraid.md`](unraid.md#acoustic-analysis--expressive-voices-the-tts-heavy-sidecar)
for the Unraid-specific walkthrough.

### Run just one engine (Chatterbox *or* PocketTTS)

Both engines are baked into the `tts-heavy` image, and by default the sidecar
loads **both** on boot. But each one is a separate PyTorch model: loading it
costs RAM, a multi-gigabyte weight download the first time, and 30–60 s of
startup. If your personas only use one engine, tell the sidecar to skip the
other — one line in `.env`, no rebuild:

```ini
# root .env — comma-separated; default is "chatterbox,pocket-tts" (both)
TTS_HEAVY_ENGINES=pocket-tts       # PocketTTS only — Chatterbox never loads
# TTS_HEAVY_ENGINES=chatterbox     # Chatterbox only
```

Then `docker compose --profile tts-heavy up -d` (recreates the sidecar). The
skipped engine's worker never starts, so you reclaim its memory and its cold
load. If a persona is still pointed at the disabled engine, its `/speak` calls
return a clean `503` and the DJ falls back to Piper — nothing goes silent.

`GET /health` on the sidecar reports `enabled: [...]` (what it was told to load)
alongside `engines: [...]` (what it can speak with right now), so you can
confirm the selection took. An empty or all-typo value falls back to loading
both, so a bad entry never silently disables all heavy TTS.

### A house Chatterbox voice for personas that have none

Chatterbox clones a voice from a reference WAV, and normally each persona
carries its own (**Settings → Voices**, a filename in the voices directory).
A persona with no voice set falls back to Chatterbox's built-in one. If you'd
rather it fell back to a voice of yours, name that file once:

```ini
# root .env — a path INSIDE the container; /var/sub-wave is the shared state
# mount, so state/voices/house.wav on the host is this:
CHATTERBOX_REFERENCE_WAV=/var/sub-wave/voices/house.wav
```

Then `docker compose --profile tts-heavy up -d`. A persona's own voice always
wins; this only fills the gap. The all-in-one image reads the same variable for
its in-process Chatterbox — before #1591 the sidecar was the odd one out, and
setting this with `--profile tts-heavy` did nothing.

### Let an idle engine go (memory back while the station is quiet)

`TTS_HEAVY_ENGINES` is the answer for an engine you *never* want. For one you
want at 8pm and not at 4am, the sidecar releases it on its own.

Chatterbox is around 4 GB resident — the weights, plus torch's CUDA context on
a GPU host — and it used to hold that for the life of the container whether or
not the station had said a word all day. The programme's idle pause
(**Settings → Stream → pause when the room is empty**) stands the *music* down,
but it has no reach into this container, so the engines stayed warm through the
whole quiet stretch. Now each engine keeps its own idle clock: after
`TTS_HEAVY_IDLE_UNLOAD_S` seconds without a spoken line, its worker is stopped
and the memory goes back to the host.

```ini
# root .env — seconds; empty = 1800 on cuda, 3600 on cpu; 0 = always resident
TTS_HEAVY_IDLE_UNLOAD_S=1800
# CHATTERBOX_IDLE_UNLOAD_S=      # per-engine overrides win over the shared value
# POCKET_TTS_IDLE_UNLOAD_S=0     # e.g. keep the small, fast engine loaded
```

Three things worth knowing:

- **The reload is real, and it is paid by whoever speaks next** — 30–60 s for a
  Chatterbox that has to come back from a warm cache. The defaults sit far
  above any gap a talking station produces (the DJ can be offered a slot every
  five minutes), so the release only fires when the station has genuinely gone
  quiet. Shortening the window to a few minutes converts a memory problem into
  a latency problem.
- **How much of it you hear depends on the idle pause.** The controller warms
  the sidecar from two places. The good one is the idle pause releasing
  (**Settings → Stream → pause when the room is empty**): the reload starts as
  the room fills up, minutes before the first link, and you hear nothing at
  all. That switch is **off by default**, though — so on a stock station the
  only warm is the second one, fired the minute the DJ decides to talk, where
  the load merely overlaps writing and rendering the script. Expect part of a
  cold Chatterbox reload to be audible as a longer-than-usual gap before the
  first line after a quiet stretch. **If the idle unload matters to you, turn
  the idle pause on as well** — the two features were built for the same quiet
  station and they work best together.
- **Nothing goes silent if the reload fails.** A load that doesn't arrive in
  `TTS_HEAVY_LOAD_TIMEOUT_S` (90 s, settable in the root `.env`) returns a
  `503`, and a load the sidecar abandons sooner than that — a missing venv, a
  fatal model error — returns one straight away rather than holding the line
  for the full ceiling. Either way the DJ falls through to its rescue voice
  exactly as it would for a sidecar that was down, and the music never stops.

The container log names each release and each wake, and `GET /health` carries
the same state: `cold: [...]` is the engines currently unloaded (still listed in
`engines`, because they are one on-demand load from speaking), `unloads` counts
the releases per engine, and `chatterbox_loaded` / `pocket_loaded` say what is
resident this second. That is the honest way to confirm the reclaim — watching
`docker stats` alone can't tell a released model from a quiet one.

```bash
docker exec sub-wave-controller wget -qO- http://tts-heavy:8080/health
# {"ok":true,"engines":["chatterbox"],"cold":["chatterbox"],"unloads":{"chatterbox":3},...}
```

The admin **Settings → Voice** engine badge says the same thing in one word:
a released engine reads `idle · loads on demand` rather than `ready`. It stays
selectable, because it is still a working voice.

To force a reload by hand — before a show, say — `POST /warm`:

```bash
docker exec sub-wave-controller wget -qO- --post-data '{"engine":""}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' http://tts-heavy:8080/warm
# {"ok":true,"warming":["chatterbox"],"disabled":[],"loaded":[],"cold":[]}
```

It returns at once without waiting for the load. `warming` is what this call
started — empty means there was nothing to do, which is the normal answer on a
station that is already talking. `disabled` names an engine you asked for that
`TTS_HEAVY_ENGINES` never loaded, so a typo'd profile doesn't read as "already
warm". `loaded` is residency this second and `cold` is what is still released;
note that `/health`'s `engines` means something different — everything the DJ
may route to, cold engines included.

---

## Verify it's running

```bash
# Container is up
docker ps --filter name=tts-heavy

# Backend answers (from inside the controller's network)
docker exec sub-wave-controller wget -qO- http://tts-heavy:8080/health
```

In the UI, open **admin → Library** (the tagging panel). The acoustic-coverage
bar reads **off** when the backend isn't reachable and fills in as analysis
runs once it is. For voices, **admin → Settings → TTS** lets you pick Chatterbox
or PocketTTS; if the sidecar isn't up yet, the page shows a short note telling
you to start it.

---

## What analysis adds

With the engine on, run a scan from **admin → Library → Rescan** (tick
**re-analyse** to (re)compute acoustic data). Each track gets:

- **Tempo (BPM)** and **musical key** (Camelot wheel in the Observatory).
- **Loudness** and an **intro length** estimate.
- An **audio "sounds-like" embedding** — a learned fingerprint of the recording
  itself, so the DJ can find neighbours by *sound* rather than only by tag text.

This is what lights up the **Library Observatory** (admin → Observatory) — the
energy ramp, the loudness/tempo histograms, the key wheel, and the audio-vector
heatmap.

### Two extra capabilities, both opt-in

- **Audio "sounds-like" embedding (CLAP)** — gated on `ANALYZE_AUDIO_EMBEDDING`.
  The admin Rescan toggles it per-run; set `ANALYZE_AUDIO_EMBEDDING=1` in your
  root `.env` to make it always-on.
- **Vocal-activity detection (Demucs)** — separates vocal vs instrumental
  energy.

Both ship only in the **heavy** analyzer image (`subwave-analyzer-heavy`). If you
see basic BPM/key working but vocal or "sounds-like" data missing, you're on the
lean analyzer — enable the heavy tier with `ANALYZER_HEAVY=1`
([above](#enabling-sounds-like--vocals-the-heavy-tier)), not by pulling `tts-heavy`.

### Running analysis without a sidecar (dev / offline)

The analyzer has a third backend: a **local Python venv** with `librosa`
installed. Point the controller at it with `ANALYZE_PYTHON=/path/to/venv/bin/python`
and it runs analysis in-process, no sidecar needed. This is mainly for
contributors on a dev machine; production should use a sidecar.

## Troubleshooting: "acoustic engine is off"

1. **Is the analyzer running?** `docker ps --filter name=sub-wave-analyzer`. It's
   a default service, so a plain `docker compose up -d` should start it — if
   nothing lists, it was stopped or scaled out. Bring it back with
   `docker compose up -d analyzer`. (On the AIO there's no separate container —
   analysis runs in-process; confirm `ANALYZE_PYTHON` is configured rather than
   looking for a sidecar.)
2. **Is it reachable?** `docker exec sub-wave-controller wget -qO- http://analyzer:8080/health`
   No answer → check the logs: `docker logs sub-wave-analyzer`. If the analyzer
   is hosted elsewhere, run the same `/health` check against `ANALYZE_URL`.
3. **Did the model still warm up?** The first *sounds-like/vocals* run downloads
   CLAP/Demucs weights into the analyzer's HF cache; the `/health` probe may
   report not-ready for a minute or two on a cold start. Give it time, then
   re-check the admin panel — the probe re-runs about once a minute, so it flips to
   available on its own. (Plain bpm/key/loudness needs no download.)
   If it never warms up, the download itself is the usual reason — see
   [the heavy image needs to reach huggingface.co once](#the-heavy-image-needs-to-reach-huggingfaceco-once).
   `/health` reports it: `analyze_audio_capable: false` alongside an
   `analyze_audio_error` naming the cause.
4. **Same track count every run?** "audio backfill: +90 already-analysed tracks
   missing an audio vector", the same 90, forever, means the pass is re-targeting
   tracks it can't fill. Either the model isn't loading (step 3 — the admin panel
   now names the reason), or those specific files fail to decode. The Library
   panel lists the failing tracks with their errors once any track has failed
   three times, and stops retrying them until you clear the list.
5. **Lost your tags after a restart?** That's a *separate* issue from the engine
   being off — it means `state/` didn't come back on the same path, so the
   controller created a fresh empty `library.db`. See the data-persistence note
   in [`unraid.md`](unraid.md#dont-lose-your-library-on-reboot-pin-state_dir).

## Resource notes

The sidecar is CPU-bound by default and works fine for analysis on a modest
box, just slowly. For heavy *voices* (Chatterbox especially) a GPU is the
difference between comfortable and painful — see the in-app
**manual → How the DJ Works** for the per-engine trade-offs. Analysis is a
one-time pass per track (cached in
`library.db`), so even on CPU it's a "let it churn overnight" job, not a
per-broadcast cost.

Observatory** for what the analysis data looks like once it's populated.

# The SUB/WAVE MCP Server

How an AI agent talks to the radio station — requesting songs, queueing exact
tracks, and driving the DJ (voice, segments, skills, sound effects) on-air over
the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

The server lives at [`mcp-subwave/`](../mcp-subwave/). For the always-on
broadcast pipeline see [`streaming-flow.md`](./streaming-flow.md); for the
human listener request path see [`request-flow.md`](./request-flow.md). For the
whole HTTP API (and a live playground), see [`api.md`](./api.md) or the admin
**Connect** page (`/admin/connect`).

---

## The short version

There are two ways to connect — both expose the **same twenty tools** from
the **same source** (`controller/src/mcp/`):

```
Recommended — HTTP (no clone, no local process):
  MCP client  ──Streamable HTTP──▶  Controller  /api/mcp
  (Claude Code / Desktop)           (Express, behind Caddy)

Local alternative — stdio (runs from a repo clone via tsx):
  MCP client  ──stdio/JSON-RPC──▶  mcp-subwave  ──HTTP──▶  Controller :7701
```

The tools own no state and almost no logic of their own — each is a typed
wrapper over one controller HTTP endpoint (the one exception:
`subwave_request_song` polls the request receipt so the agent gets an outcome,
not a ticket). The model gets twenty tools; the controller does the real work
(LLM matching, track selection, TTS, queueing).

**HTTP endpoint (recommended).** The controller serves MCP directly at
`/api/mcp` (a stateless Streamable-HTTP transport). Connect with just a URL:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http subwave https://your-station/api/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Basic $(printf '%s' "$ADMIN_USER:$ADMIN_PASS" | base64)"
```

Auth mirrors the REST API: read tools work unauthenticated; DJ-control tools
need the station's admin credentials in the `Authorization` header. A private
station's `subwave_similar_tracks` takes its *listener* password in an
`x-station-auth` header — a separate secret, forwarded the same way. No clone,
no build, no separate process.

It is the agent-facing twin of the listener request drawer: where a human types
into the browser and hits `POST /request`, an agent calls `subwave_request_song`
and the same endpoint runs.

---

## Why an MCP server (and not a skill)

A Claude Code *skill* is instructions — it would tell a model to `curl` the
controller itself. An *MCP server* is a typed capability surface: the tools,
their schemas, their auth, and their error handling are defined once, in code,
and every MCP client gets them identically. For an action surface that mutates
station state and carries rate limits and admin auth, that contract belongs in
code, not prose. The agent never sees a URL or an auth header — only
intent-shaped tools.

### Read tools — `subwave_health`, `subwave_now_playing`, `subwave_station_state`, `subwave_schedule`, `subwave_session`

All read-only passthroughs. `now-playing` returns the current track, station
context (time, weather, dominant mood), and live listener counts; `state`
returns the upcoming queue, recent history, and the DJ booth log; `schedule`
the personas, shows, and weekly grid (in the station's timezone); `session`
the DJ's live session identity and recent transcript turns.

These exist so the agent can ground a request in what's actually on-air. A
request like *"something slower than this"* is only meaningful if the model
first knows what *this* is — the controller's `matchRequest` interprets vibe
queries against the current track, so a good agent reads before it writes.
`schedule` matters for the show-bound segments: `banter` needs a guest show on
air, `programme-*` a programme show.

### `subwave_request_song` and `subwave_request_status`

The headline tool. Takes a natural-language `request` (a track, an artist, a
vibe, or `"more like this"`) and an optional `requester` name. `POST /request`
hands back a **202 receipt** and the booth resolves the request in the
background (LLM matcher, pick cascade, spoken intro, queue push) — so the tool
polls `GET /request/:id` (2s interval, ~45s budget) and reports the outcome:
matched track + queue position + the DJ's ack, or the miss message. If the
booth is still working past the budget, the tool returns the `requestId` and
points the agent at `subwave_request_status`.

Three things the tool description makes explicit to the model, because they
are easy to get wrong:

- **It queues, it does not interrupt.** A request lands *after* the current
  song. (Listeners have no skip; the admin-gated `subwave_skip_track` is the
  deliberate operator override.)
- **It is rate-limited.** The public `/request` endpoint allows 1 call per 20s
  and 8 per hour per source. On an HTTP 429 the tool surfaces the controller's
  `Retry-After` in its error text, so the agent can back off instead of
  hammering.
- **It pauses with the station.** With zero listeners tuned in the DJ idles
  and `/request` returns 503 — the controller's explanation is passed through.

### `subwave_search_library` and `subwave_queue_track`

The deterministic path: search Navidrome by terms (12 queue-ready results with
mood tags), then queue an exact result by id. Admin-gated, no LLM, no rate
limit, no DJ intro. This is the right pair when the agent already knows the
exact track; `subwave_request_song` is for vibes and natural language.

### `subwave_similar_tracks`

The sound-alike lookup the admin Library panel runs, exposed to an API caller.
It KNNs the CLAP audio embedding — timbre, instrumentation, production, energy,
derived from the waveform — so it is blind to tags and works on instrumentals
and non-English tracks where a text search does not. Seed it with a track id
(`subwave_now_playing`'s `subsonic_id` is the obvious one) or free text that
resolves to one.

Two things separate it from the other read tools:

- **It is station-gated, not admin-gated.** A public station serves it with no
  credential at all; a private one wants the listener password. An operator's
  call-in agent gets library reads without the admin console.
- **A library with no audio analysis is not an error.** `results` comes back
  empty with a `reason` — `no-audio-index` (the station has no CLAP vectors at
  all, so it needs the heavy analyzer), `seed-not-analysed` (this track
  specifically), `seed-not-found`, or `no-neighbours`. An agent can tell "ask
  again after the analysis pass" from "your track id is wrong", which a bare
  empty list or a 503 does not allow.

Never-play tracks are filtered out on the way, at the library's own blocklist
chokepoint.

### `subwave_dj_announce`

Puts a spoken update on-air via `POST /dj/say`. Three axes:

- **`mode`** — `styled` (default) hands the text to the LLM as an *instruction*
  and the DJ rewrites it in persona before speaking; `raw` speaks the text
  verbatim. Give a topic → `styled`. Give finished words → `raw` (also the
  right choice for emergency wording that must not be paraphrased).
- **`placement`** — `solo` (default) is a heavy-ducked solo DJ moment (maps to
  the controller's `dj-speak` kind → `say.txt`); `over-track` is lightly ducked
  so the DJ talks over the playing song (maps to `link` → `intro.txt`).
- **`sfx`** — optional name of a library sound effect aired under the opening
  words as an attention stinger (e.g. `airhorn` ahead of a weather warning).
  Names come from `subwave_list_sfx`; an unknown name is a 400 listing the
  catalogue.

### `subwave_dj_segment`

Fires a scripted voice segment on demand: `station-id`, `hourly`, `link`,
`banter` (multi-voice guest exchange — needs a guest show on air), or
`programme-intro` / `programme-feature` / `programme-outro` (episode beats —
need a programme show on air). This is an operator override: it bypasses the
DJ's `shouldFire` frequency gate. For a custom message, `subwave_dj_announce`
is the right tool.

### `subwave_list_skills` and `subwave_run_skill`

`list` returns the skill catalogue — the seven built-ins (weather, news,
traffic, curiosity, album-anniversary, library-deep-cut, web-search) plus any
operator-authored skills from `state/skills/`. `run` fires one by name through
the segment director, which fetches real data (forecast, headlines, …) before
voicing it. Manual runs ignore cooldowns and work even on disabled skills.

### `subwave_list_sfx` and `subwave_play_sfx`

`list` returns the sound-effects library (short stingers, ≤10s). `play` fires
one on-air immediately, mixed over the programme with a light duck — the
automation-facing trigger for external alerting agents. To pair a stinger with
spoken words, prefer `subwave_dj_announce`'s `sfx` parameter, which aligns the
effect with the voice's first words.

### `subwave_list_jingles` and `subwave_play_jingle`

`list` returns the jingle library — idents, sweepers and event announcements.
`play` queues one to air at the next track boundary, at **full level, with the
programme yielding to it**.

This is the tool for anything longer than a stinger. `subwave_play_sfx` mixes
its clip *under* the music with only a light duck, which is why effects are
capped at 10 seconds: a longer one keeps droning over the programme after the
moment has passed. A jingle is its own item in the music chain instead, and has
no length cap — a sponsor spot or a two-minute event announcement is fine.

It is queued, not instant. There is no skip in this system: Liquidsoap owns
pacing and track-end is the only natural transition, so the clip airs when the
current song finishes rather than cutting it off. Like `subwave_play_sfx`, it is
a manual trigger and ignores the station's jingle-rotation dial — turning the
rotate off silences the automatic draw, never an explicit call.

**Do not retry a call that succeeded.** The queue behind this has no cancel, so
a second push of the same clip airs the announcement twice back to back. Calling
again while the first is still waiting for its boundary is refused (`409`,
`"… is already queued and hasn't aired yet"`) — treat that as "your press
landed", not as a failure to retry. Two *different* announcements queue normally.

## Authentication

The controller splits its surface in two (see
[`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) → middleware):

- **Public** — `/health`, `/now-playing`, `/state`, `/schedule`, `/session`,
  `/request` (rate-limited), `/request/:id`. No auth.
- **Station-password gated** — `/similar-tracks`. Gated by the station's
  *listener* password (Settings → Privacy), a different secret from the admin
  one, and a different failure direction: open on a public station (no locks
  on), closed on a private one. That is what lets an operator point a call-in
  agent at their library without handing it the admin console.
- **Admin, Basic-auth gated** — `/dj/*`, `/sfx` and `/jingles`. Gated by the controller's
  `ADMIN_USER` / `ADMIN_PASS`.

`subwave-mcp` reads admin credentials from its own environment
(`SUBWAVE_ADMIN_USER` / `SUBWAVE_ADMIN_PASS`) and sends them as a Basic auth
header only on the admin tools. If they are unset, the read and request tools
still work; the DJ-control tools return an error that names exactly which
env vars to set. The credentials live in the MCP client's config, never in a
prompt.

---

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SUBWAVE_API_URL` | `http://localhost:7701` | Controller base URL. Prod behind Caddy: `http://localhost:7700/api`. |
| `SUBWAVE_ADMIN_USER` | — | Matches the controller's `ADMIN_USER`. |
| `SUBWAVE_ADMIN_PASS` | — | Matches the controller's `ADMIN_PASS`. |
| `SUBWAVE_STATION_PASSWORD` | — | Matches `settings.privacy.password`. Only needed for `subwave_similar_tracks` on a station with a privacy lock on. |

In dev the controller is exposed directly on `:7701`. In prod only Caddy binds
a host port, so the server must target `:7700/api` — the `handle_path` rule
strips the `/api` prefix before the controller sees the route.

---

## Error handling

Every failure becomes a `SubwaveError` whose message is written for the *agent*
to act on, not for a log:

- **Controller unreachable** → names the URL it tried and the dev/prod
  defaults to check.
- **HTTP 429** → the cooldown in seconds, plus the rate-limit policy.
- **HTTP 401/403** → whether credentials are missing entirely or simply don't
  match the controller's.
- **HTTP 503** → the controller's own explanation is passed through — song
  requests closed by the operator (`REQUESTS_DISABLED`) or the zero-listener
  autopilot pause.

The tool wrapper catches these and returns them as MCP error results
(`isError: true`) rather than throwing, so the model sees the message and can
recover within the same turn.

---

## Running it

**HTTP (recommended)** needs nothing installed — the controller already serves
`/api/mcp` whenever the stack is up. Register it with the `claude mcp add
--transport http …` command above (or the admin **Connect → MCP** tab, which
pre-fills your station's URL). Copy-ready Claude Code and Claude Desktop
snippets are in [`mcp-subwave/README.md`](../mcp-subwave/README.md).

**Local stdio server** runs the standalone launcher straight from a clone via
`tsx` — no build step:

```bash
npx tsx mcp-subwave/src/index.ts                     # run it
cd mcp-subwave && npm run inspect                    # MCP Inspector for manual testing
```

Wire it into a client with `npx tsx /absolute/path/to/subwave/mcp-subwave/src/index.ts`
plus the `SUBWAVE_API_URL` / `SUBWAVE_ADMIN_USER` / `SUBWAVE_ADMIN_PASS` env
vars. Inside this repo, the root [`.mcp.json`](../.mcp.json) already wires it up
for Claude Code — the tools are available in any session opened here.

Either way the controller must be running first — start the stack with the
`subwave-control` skill or `docker compose up -d` (see [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md)).

## Source map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `controller/src/mcp/tools.ts` | `registerSubwaveTools(server, client)` — the 17 tool definitions + request polling + error-to-result wrapper. The single source both transports share. |
| `controller/src/mcp/client.ts` | `SubwaveClient` — typed HTTP client, Basic auth (or a forwarded `Authorization` header), `SubwaveError` with actionable messages. |
| `controller/src/routes/mcp.ts` | The built-in HTTP endpoint — stateless Streamable HTTP at `/mcp`, per-request loopback client that forwards the caller's auth. |
| `controller/src/mcp/stdio.ts` | The stdio bootstrap — connects the shared tools to a stdio transport. |
| `mcp-subwave/src/index.ts` | Thin `tsx` launcher that imports `stdio.ts` from the clone (keeps one SDK copy). |
| `mcp-subwave/package.json` | The standalone launcher — `tsx` dep, no build step. |

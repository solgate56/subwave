# Open suggestion threads (Discord), cross-referenced against GitHub

Every thread in the community [#suggestions forum](https://discord.com/channels/1514647956333002812/1519660466933207223) that is **not** tagged `✅ Implemented`, with the matching GitHub issue and whether the ask has actually landed.

Captured 2026-09-06 — 65 of 125 threads, checked against all 334 issues (28 open) plus `git log` on `develop`. A snapshot, not a live view; the forum and the issue tracker are the sources of truth. Statuses are a judgement call from titles, bodies and commit history — the 🟡 and ⬜ rows are the ones most worth a second look.

## Status at a glance

| Status | Count | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| ✅ Shipped | 6 | Delivered on `develop`; the thread can be closed out. |
| 🔨 Tracked | 14 | An **open** GitHub issue covers it. |
| 🟡 Partly covered | 19 | Related work has landed, but the specific ask has not. |
| ⬜ No issue | 26 | Nothing on GitHub — needs filing or an explicit reply. |

Open GitHub issues doing the most work here: [#1485](https://github.com/perminder-klair/subwave/issues/1485) (the follow-up tracker, 5 threads), [#1486](https://github.com/perminder-klair/subwave/issues/1486) (CarPlay + Android Auto, 2 threads) and [#1400](https://github.com/perminder-klair/subwave/issues/1400) (skill-aimed banter, 2 threads).

> Since I run the Analyzer on another PC, and the YAML files need updating some times, is it possible to add some syntax to the .env file that would allow me to…

**🔨 Tracked** — Tracked as an item on the open triage issue #1570, and the work has landed on `develop`: `ANALYZER_REPLICAS=0` in the root `.env` removes the local analyzer container across all three composes, for operators running analysis elsewhere via ANALYZE_URL (#1538 added the concurrency control for that remote path). Moves to ✅ Shipped when #1570 closes.

**🔨 Tracked** — #1599 is the open issue, and it is exactly this ask: an add-a-range control beside the show editor's decade chips, so a single year ("2026 only") or an open-ended window is reachable from the admin UI rather than only through a hand-written PATCH. Implemented and in review, not yet on `develop`. Era resolution itself was fixed earlier (#842, #1418). Moves to ✅ Shipped when #1599 closes.

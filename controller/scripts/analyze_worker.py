Acoustic-analysis worker — line-protocol child process.

The Node side (controller/src/music/analyzer.ts) spawns this once and keeps it
alive, because importing librosa takes a couple of seconds and we don't want to
eat that per track in a bulk pass. Protocol is one JSON object per line over
stdin/stdout, same shape as the Kokoro/PocketTTS workers.

Request:  {"id": "<song id>", "url": "<http stream url>"}   (worker downloads)
       |  {"id": "<song id>", "path": "<local file path>"}  (caller owns it)
Response: {"id": "<echoed>", "ok": true, "bpm": 122.0, "key": "8A",
           "intro_ms": 8200, "confidence": 0.71,
           "audio_embedding": [/* 512 floats, OPTIONAL */]}
       |  {"id": "<echoed>", "ok": false, "error": "..."}

`audio_embedding` is present ONLY when ANALYZE_AUDIO_EMBEDDING is enabled AND a
CLAP model loaded — a 512-d, L2-normalised vector of how the track SOUNDS
(timbre / instrumentation / production), derived from the waveform itself. When
disabled or the model is absent the field is omitted entirely and the worker
behaves exactly as it did before (bpm/key/intro only) — never a hard failure.

This deliberately lives OUTSIDE the controller image — librosa pulls in
numba/scipy/soundfile, which the controller must stay lean of. It runs in the
analyzer sidecar (and the AIO's in-process venv), or in a standalone offline
venv on the operator's machine. Audio is fetched from the Subsonic stream URL (auth baked
into the query string) to a temp file, then only the first ANALYZE_SECONDS are
decoded — enough for tempo/key and the intro estimate, a fraction of the bytes.
(The CLAP embedding additionally decodes a mid-song and a late window from the
same file — see embed_windows — so the vector reflects the whole track, not
just its intro.)

The embedder also answers text requests ({"texts": [...]}) with CLAP
text-tower embeddings in the SAME 512-d space, which is what makes
natural-language "sounds like ..." search and zero-shot mood scoring against
the stored audio vectors possible.

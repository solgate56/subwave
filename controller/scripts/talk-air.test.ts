// Pins the talk PLACEMENT switch (settings.djTalkOnlyBetweenTracks →
// broadcast/talk-air.ts), #1485 FR 5b.
//
// Two things are worth pinning here, and neither is the planner's (that lives
// in scripts/talk-scheduler.test.ts, which replays whole hours with the switch
// both ways):
//
//  - THE UPGRADE IS BYTE-IDENTICAL. The key defaults false and every way of
//    NOT having it — a settings.json written before it existed, a hand-edited
//    non-boolean — has to read false too. Coercing a stray string to `true`
//    would silently move every segment on an upgraded station.
//  - THE SCOPE IS WHAT EXEMPTS MANUAL TRIGGERS. `currentTalkAir()` reads
//    'immediate' outside any scope, which is where every /dj route calls the
//    same gate-free runners from, and it has to survive an await — the scope
//    wraps a runner whose speech happens several awaits deep, which is the only
//    reason a scope is usable here at all.
//
// STATE_DIR is redirected before the first import, like clock-policy.test.ts.

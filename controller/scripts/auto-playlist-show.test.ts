// Pins the auto.m3u SHOW-CHANGE rebuild (#1111) — broadcast/auto-playlist-show.ts
// and its four wiring points in broadcast/scheduler.ts.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS GUARDS. `refreshAutoPlaylist` steers the fallback pool by the
// resolved active show, but it only ever ran at boot and on the
// `autoQueueRefreshMinutes` cron (default 60). A show change landing between
// two ticks therefore left the PREVIOUS show's file on disk, and with the live
// queue empty the station coasted on it: the report's Playlist Only (Strict)
// show had 26 of 28 fallback entries outside its pinned playlist until the
// operator pressed Refresh, after which all 16 were inside it. Strict is
// enforced correctly whenever the file is rebuilt — nothing was rebuilding it.
//
// The properties, and the real way each regresses:
//
//  - COMING OFF A SHOW IS A CHANGE. A key that only tracks a show's id, with no
//    identity for "no show on air", leaves the ended show's strict fallback
//    playing over default programming — the second half of every scheduled
//    boundary.
//  - AN EDIT TO THE LIVE SHOW IS A CHANGE. The pool is steered by the show's
//    genres, eras, energies, moods, vocals, strictness, pinned playlists,
//    excluded playlists and length cap, not by its id — an id-only key reports
//    "same show" for a show that now asks for entirely different music.
//  - A REORDER IS NOT. Lists are sorted into the key, so re-ordering genres in
//    the editor — which cannot change the pool — must not spend a rebuild's
//    worth of Navidrome round trips at the next boundary.
//  - A FAILED REBUILD STAYS STALE. The stamp records a build that LANDED. If a
//    throw stamped anyway, the one path that retries (the next boundary) would
//    read the stale file as current and the station would coast on the previous
//    show until the refresh cron came round — the original bug, restored.
//  - A CLAIM IS TAKEN BEFORE THE AWAIT. rollSessionNow has four call sites and
//    two can land in the same second (an expiry sweep against an operator's
//    cancel); without the claim both fan out the same Navidrome queries.
//
// The wiring itself is scraped from source: `refreshAutoPlaylistOnShowChange`
// ends in a live Navidrome fan-out, so there is no runtime seam that
// distinguishes "the hook fired" from "the hook is gone" without a real
// library behind it — the same reason picker-show-source.test.ts scrapes.
// Deliberately narrow: the anchors are the call in rollSessionNow, the stamp at
// the end of the refresh, and the four transitions naming themselves.
//

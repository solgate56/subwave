// Concurrency regression test for music/never-play-ignore.ts:
//
//   1. First-load race — the module used to set a `loaded` flag SYNCHRONOUSLY
//      before `await readFile(...)` resolved, so a second caller arriving
//      while the first read was still in flight saw `loaded === true` and
//      proceeded against a still-empty `ignoredPaths`, silently missing
//      whatever was already on disk.
//   2. Concurrent-mutation race — once add()/remove() were changed to
//      compute-next → persist → publish (so a failed write can't corrupt
//      in-memory state), two concurrent mutations computing `next` from the
//      same pre-mutation snapshot could each persist a smaller list and the
//      second one to finish would silently discard the first's change.
//
// Both are exercised by making the VERY FIRST operations against a fresh
// module instance be two concurrent add() calls, against a root whose
// .ndignore ALREADY has a pre-existing line written directly (not through
// the module) before import — so a premature "loaded" short-circuit would
// be observable as that pre-existing entry going missing from the final
// result, and a lost update would be observable as one of the two new
// entries going missing.
//
// Its own file (rather than a section of scripts/never-play-ignore.test.ts):
// this needs to be the literal first thing the module does in this process,
// which a shared-root file already mid-way through other assertions can't
// offer — run-tests.ts gives every *.test.ts file its own subprocess, so a
// fresh module instance here is free.
//
// Run: `tsx scripts/never-play-ignore-concurrency.test.ts` or via `npm test`.

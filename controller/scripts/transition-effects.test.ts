// Per-effect transition switches (#1565) — the operator lever that is narrower
// than `djMode`.
//
// Five things regress here, each reached from a different line so any one of
// them going missing is silent:
//
//  - ABSENT MEANS ON. A station that has never written the block behaves
//    exactly as it did before the block existed, and so does one whose stored
//    block is malformed. This is what makes the upgrade byte-identical.
//  - The PATCH is per-field. `transitions.effects` is a nested block, so the
//    applier needs its own loop: a patch naming only `dissolve` must not reset
//    the other five.
//  - The PROMPT gates before generation. A switched-off gesture is dropped from
//    the pool path's enum and named as unavailable in the guidance, and with
//    every one off the whole block disappears — the same prompt a non-DJ
//    persona gets.
//  - The DRAIN strip is TARGETED. Sweep shapes entry and washout exit, so a
//    pick can legitimately carry both; switching one off must not take the
//    other with it (which is what the blanket stripEffect would do).
//  - The AUTO-WASHOUT honours the switch. It is deterministic rather than a DJ
//    choice, but it is the same gesture at the same cost.
//
// Plus a drift check on the admin form's copy of the list, which cannot import
// the controller's.

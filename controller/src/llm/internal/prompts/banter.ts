// Multi-voice banter — a short scripted exchange between the show's host and
// guest co-hosts, aired between tracks. One structured-output call writes the
// WHOLE exchange (a per-line call would multiply latency and lose the
// back-and-forth); each line is then rendered in its speaker's own TTS voice
// and aired back-to-back through the serialized voice chain
// (queue.announceExchange). Speaker ids ride a per-call Zod enum, so the model
// can't invent a voice we can't render — and that enum stays STRICT: a speaker
// repaired into whichever persona looks closest airs the line in the wrong
// voice, which is worse than losing the beat. settings.castSpeakerIdRule() is
// the prompt-side mitigation for the rejections that follow from that (#1512);
// it lowers the odds of a rejected exchange and cannot rule one out.

Rules:
- ${MIN_LINES} to ${MAX_LINES} lines total, at least two different speakers. Let the turn-taking breathe — it doesn't have to alternate mechanically, but nobody monologues.
- ${settings.castSpeakerIdRule()}
- Each speaker stays in THEIR OWN character per the voice notes. The host carries the room; guests chip in as themselves.
- Ground it in the moment you're given (the track playing, the hour, the show) — react, riff, disagree gently, tease. One thread, not a topic list.
- This is a conversation, NOT a link: do not introduce, back-announce, or name-drop the next track, do not read a station ident, do not announce the time.
- No greetings or sign-offs — the show is already rolling. No invented listener messages, callers, or events.
- Plain spoken words only: no stage directions, no asterisks, no emoji. Speaker names in supplied recap are reference-only: never prefix a spoken line with any speaker name or a name-and-colon label; the separate speaker field already routes each line to the right voice.${langClause}${settings.castHouseRulesBlock()}`;

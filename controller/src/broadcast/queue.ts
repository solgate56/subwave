  // exempt from every length rule the controller owns (maxTrackSeconds,

  // sub-crossfade track is expected to arrive at all. push() is the chokepoint
  // every producer funnels through, so the listener route's three resolutions,
  // the DJ agent's request path, MCP and the studio queue are all covered by
  // this one call — there is no branch in routes/request.ts.
  //
  // The span is the PLAYABLE one, resolved by music/silence-trim.ts: a trimmed
  // head or tail is exactly what the buffer eats, and subtracting cue points
  // here instead is the drift that module exists to prevent.
  //
  // One honest limit, which the LINE ITSELF carries rather than only this
  // comment — the line is what the operator reads. `crossfadeDuration` is the
  // CONFIGURED figure; radio.liq reads liquidsoap_crossfade.txt once at mixer
  // startup, so between a crossfade change and a /restart-mixer the mixer is
  // still buffering the old value while this warning is measured against the
  // new one. Nothing in the controller can read the live figure, and warning
  // against the setting the operator can actually act on is the useful half.
  //
  // THE WHOLE BODY IS INSIDE A try/catch, and that is the load-bearing line
  // here rather than defensiveness. `playableSpanSec` resolves through

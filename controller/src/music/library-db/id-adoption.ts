// Adoption of rotated Navidrome ids (PR #5824's uniform_canonical_ids
// migration). When Navidrome rewrites its ids, the walk inserts every track
// under a NEW id and pruneMissingTracks would hard-delete every OLD row —
// losing tags, enrichment, acoustic analysis and both vector indexes for the
// whole library. This module runs between walk and prune: an orphan whose
// canonicalId() image is a DIFFERENT id that the walk just saw live gets its
// derived columns, vector rows and play attribution moved onto the new row,
// then the old row is deleted so the prune has nothing left to do.
//
// Self-validating by construction: the mapping only fires when the canonical
// image exists in the live-id set, so on a server that never migrated (or if
// upstream changes the transform before release) nothing matches and the sync
// behaves byte-for-byte like today. A genuinely deleted track fails the
// `image !== old` test (hash-family ids are fixed points) and still prunes.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Which columns move
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// **The carried set is DERIVED, not listed.** It is every physical column of
// `tracks` minus the two sets below, read from PRAGMA table_info at call time.
// The default therefore has to be "carry it", because the alternative is the
// failure this whole module exists to prevent: the first version of this file
// enumerated the carried columns by hand, and by the time it was reviewed the
// schema had moved seven columns past it — lead/tail silence, tail_start, the
// three analyze-failure counters and text_vector_dirty would all have been
// silently dropped on every adopted row, with `analysis_version` carried on
// top so nothing would ever re-derive them. A hand-written mirror of a schema
// that gains a column every few weeks is a data-loss bug with a delay fuse.
//
// So: a NEW column is carried automatically, and the thing you have to
// remember is the rarer case — a new column the WALK owns. `columnPlan()`
// reports anything a rule doesn't name (`unclassified`) and anything a rule
// names that the table doesn't have (`missing`); `scripts/id-adoption-columns.test.ts`
// asserts both are empty, so the next migration fails the suite rather than
// the operator's library.

// Never written by the carry UPDATE. `id` is the primary key (it IS the thing
// being changed), and `genre` is GENERATED ALWAYS — writing it throws. Today
// `genre` is VIRTUAL and PRAGMA table_info omits it anyway; naming it here
// keeps that true if it is ever made STORED.

// Re-derived by the walk on every sync (upsertTrackMeta), so the freshly
// inserted row's copy is the current truth and adoption must leave it alone.

// they need the precedence rule below, not a blanket "new wins".

// race with a later tagger phase) it keeps its whole group — mixing half a
// fresh tag set with half a carried one would leave `tagged_at`/`prompt_hash`
// describing values they didn't produce.
//
// The analyze-failure trio rides the analysis group deliberately: it is
// upsertTrackAnalysis that NULLs them on success, so anchoring on
// analysis_version is what makes "the new row was analysed cleanly" clear the
// old row's strikes, while an un-analysed new row still inherits them (a track
// that failed three times under the old id must stay out of scope under the
// new one). A plain COALESCE would resurrect the strikes onto a row that had

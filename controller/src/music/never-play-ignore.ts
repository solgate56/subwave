// Navidrome-side "never play again" exclusion — maintains ONE ignore file,
// <NEVER_PLAY_LIBRARY_PATH>/.ndignore, one gitignore-syntax pattern per line,
// each pattern deterministically derived from a library-relative song.path.
// This is the Navidrome-external half of "Never Play Again"
// (broadcast/never-play-again.ts, POST /dj/never-play-again): the in-process
// blocklist (music/blocklist.ts) is what stops SUB/WAVE itself from ever
// selecting the track again, immediately; this module is what asks Navidrome
// to drop the exact file from ITS OWN catalog too — eventually consistent,
// once Navidrome's next scan (triggered by subsonic.startScan(), best-effort)
// picks the change up. This assumes Navidrome's `.ndignore` accepts one
// gitignore-syntax pattern per line — live-verified against a real Navidrome
// instance with a bracket-containing path (see toIgnorePattern below).
//
// Disabled by default: NEVER_PLAY_LIBRARY_PATH is empty unless the operator
// bind-mounts the Navidrome music-library root into the CONTROLLER container
// and sets it. Deliberately separate from MUSIC_LIBRARY_PATH (subsonic.ts's
// playback-routing knob, consumed by the BROADCAST container via
// Liquidsoap) — this module never touches playback and only the controller
// needs this mount.
//
// State/persistence shape:
//   - `ignoredPaths` holds the escaped, gitignore-PATTERN form of every
//     ignored path — i.e. exactly what's written to / read from disk. A
//     caller's ORIGINAL song.path (the identity kept as BlockEntry.libraryPath
//     in music/blocklist.ts) is converted to its pattern via toIgnorePattern()
//     right at the add()/remove() boundary, so add(x) and remove(x) — called
//     with the SAME original x, e.g. by the block and later unblock routes —
//     always derive and compare the identical line.
//   - Mutations are compute-next → persist → publish: `ignoredPaths` is only
//     reassigned AFTER writeFileAtomic() resolves. A failed persist (a
//     missing/unwritable ROOT, disk full, …) therefore leaves the in-memory
//     list untouched, so a retried add()/remove() genuinely re-attempts the
//     disk write rather than short-circuiting on a duplicate check against
//     state that was never actually persisted.
//   - `load()` is single-flighted through one shared promise rather than a
//     boolean flag, so two callers racing on the very first add()/remove()
//     both await the SAME completed read instead of the second one
//     proceeding against a still-empty `ignoredPaths`. It populates the
//     in-memory VIEW only (list()); it is not what a mutation trusts.
//   - Every mutation RE-READS the file from disk inside the lock and computes
//     from that, never from `ignoredPaths`. `.ndignore` lives in the
//     OPERATOR's music tree, not in state/, and Navidrome documents it as
//     hand-editable — so this process is not its only writer, and a
//     whole-file rewrite computed from a snapshot taken minutes ago would
//     silently delete lines the operator added by hand in between.
//   - Every mutation (after its own load()) additionally serialises through
//     `withLock()`, a plain promise chain — compute-then-persist-then-publish
//     needs it: two concurrent add()/remove() calls targeting DIFFERENT paths
//     could otherwise both compute `next` from the same pre-mutation
//     snapshot and the second persist to land would silently discard the
//     first's change. music/blocklist.ts avoids this by mutating its
//     in-memory array BEFORE persisting (see its own `removeMany` comment on
//     the same race class); this module can't use that trick because the
//     whole point of the compute→persist→publish order is to never mutate
//     ahead of a persist that might fail.

// ── gitignore-pattern escaping ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// .ndignore is gitignore syntax, so a raw song.path written verbatim is
// interpreted as a PATTERN, not a literal filename: `*`, `?`, `[`, `]` are
// glob metacharacters usable anywhere in a pattern; a LEADING `!` negates the
// pattern; a LEADING `#` starts a comment (the whole line is ignored); `\` is
// the escape character itself; and TRAILING whitespace is stripped unless
// backslash-escaped (interior whitespace — "01 Track.flac", the ordinary
// shape of most real filenames — is already literal to gitignore and is
// deliberately left untouched, or every plain track name in a library would
// come out of this module as unreadable backslash noise). A real library
// routinely has the metacharacter cases too — box-set / deluxe-edition album
// names in particular ("Cast In Steel [Deluxe Edition]") — so writing
// song.path unescaped would silently broaden the match (a `[Live]` bracket
// pair reads as a character class, matching one character from the set
// L/i/v/e rather than the literal substring) or, for a leading `!`/`#`,
// invert or void the entry entirely.

/** Escape one path SEGMENT (a single directory/file name, no `/`) for
 *  literal matching: backslash-escape every gitignore glob metacharacter
 *  that is special ANYWHERE in a pattern (`\`, `*`, `?`, `[`, `]`).
 *  Whitespace is handled separately, once, on the fully-joined line — see
 *  toIgnorePattern — because only a TRAILING run at the very end of the
 *  whole pattern is significant; an interior space is already literal.
 *  `String.prototype.replace` with a global pattern scans the ORIGINAL
 *  string, so one pass here can't double-escape a character it already
 *  inserted a backslash before. */

 * are only special as the FIRST character of the whole line (gitignore's
 * negation/comment markers — elsewhere in a pattern they are already literal
 * and need no escaping), so that check runs once against the fully-joined
 * pattern; and any TRAILING whitespace on the joined line — the only

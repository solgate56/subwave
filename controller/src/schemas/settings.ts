// Shared schemas for individual `POST /settings` patch keys — the first slice
// of the mega-endpoint conversion (#1348, split out of #1337).
//
// HARD RULE: this file may import ONLY from 'zod'. It is copied verbatim into
// the web bundle, so a project import or a node builtin here breaks the mirror.
// Enforced by controller/eslint.config.mjs and by gen-schemas.ts.
//
// WHY A KEY AT A TIME, AND NOT ONE SCHEMA FOR THE SETTINGS OBJECT
// ---------------------------------------------------------------
// The `/settings` body is a partial PATCH: every admin panel posts only the keys
// it owns. `z.object` strips unknown keys, so a schema over the whole settings
// object would silently delete whatever a form learns to send next. Instead each
// top-level key owns its own schema here and patch-registry.ts runs only the
// keys a patch actually carries, keeping the stripping scoped to blocks whose
// shape is fully known.
//
// FIDELITY IS THE POINT
// ---------------------
// No conversion may introduce a silent repair where the operator previously got
// a refusal, or vice versa (#1337's rule). The hand-rolled branches these
// replace carry a lot of ACCIDENTAL leniency, and reproducing it is most of the
// work:
//
//   * `parseInt`/`parseFloat` stringify first, so '5' and even '5abc' parse, and
//     a float on an int key TRUNCATES rather than failing (jingleRatio: 5.7
//     saves as 5). `z.number().int()` refuses all three — hence
//     settingsIntLike / settingsFloatLike.
//   * `!!value` accepts anything, so `enabled: 1` is `true`. See settingsBoolLike.
//   * `patch.beds || {}` makes a non-object block a silent no-op, not an error.
//     See settingsBlockOf.
//
// Tightening any of these is defensible — webhooks did exactly that — but it is
// a behaviour change and belongs in a PR that says so, so the frame itself can't
// be what hides a regression.
//
// The bounds live HERE rather than in defaults.ts's BOUNDS because a mirrored
// module may not import a non-mirrored one and the browser needs the same
// numbers to pre-flight the form; BOUNDS re-exports them. The web side must read
// from the mirror rather than hand-copying — which is what BedsSection did with
// a bare `60` and `15`.
